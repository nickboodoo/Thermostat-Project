# Thermostat Project

The main goal of this project was to learn more about using a microcontroller from Texas Instruments. I picked up the TI microcontroller so that I could learn more about embedded systems and programmingin embedded C.

I think that overall I did a pretty good job with the project, however I know that I can try to make the code a little more efficient. This particular board does not have that much onboard memory to work with and every bit of it counts.
