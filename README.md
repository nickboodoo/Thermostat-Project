# Thermostat Project

The main goal of this project was to learn more about using a microcontroller from Texas Instruments. I picked up the TI microcontroller so that I could learn more about embedded systems and programmingin embedded C.

With embedded C, I created a loop feedback system seen in the drawio pdf file. The loop begins when the temperature is read and input is read in the form of a delay. If the button check passes, the program then waits to see which buttont he user pressed and will increment or decrement the temperature accordingly. All information will then be displayed to the user and the loop is repeated. If no button is pressed, the loop continues and increments the time and waits for input. 

I think that overall I did a pretty good job with the project, however I know that I can try to make the code a little more efficient. This particular board does not have that much onboard memory to work with and every bit of it counts.
